# RestaurantService

A simple API made up of this microservice as well as [OrdersService](https://github.com/bconnelly/OrdersService), [CustomersService](https://github.com/bconnelly/CustomersService) and [TablesService](https://github.com/bconnelly/TablesService). Hosted in a kubernetes cluster on AWS, records stored in a MySQL RDS instance. This service is public-facing while the others communicate within the cluster. Commits to master are only made by Jenkins script if rc branch deploys successfully.

### Scripts
